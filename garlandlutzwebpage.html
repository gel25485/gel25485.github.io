					<h2> Introduction </h2>
					</div>
						<p> My name is Garland Elaine Lutz.  I was born on September 15, 1998, to Eric and Stacey Lutz.  I was born in Valdosta, Georgia.  My family lived in Homerville until soon after my brother was born.  We then moved to the family farm, where my father and grandfather put in a blackberry field.  My father owns the independent insurance agency in Homerville, and my mother is the in charge of the Governor's Leadership Academy.  The blackberries did not last long, and the fields were soon converted to blueberries. My parents divorced when I was ten, and my dad, brother, and myself have lived on the farm since.

			<p> <b> My senior year I was accepted into the University of Georgia.</b> </p>
			<p>  <i> I decided to do freshco. </i> Freshco was the best and worst decision I could have made.  During the summer, I was not happy at all.  However once the school year started, I was extrememly glad I did it. Freshman year, I rushed Sigma Kappa.  My major changed many times freshman year from Exercise and Sport Science to AgBusiness to Human Development and a few others before I finally got to Risk Management and Insurance.  My father and my uncle were both risk management degree earners at the University of Georgia back in their day.  My goal is to go back home and take over the family business when I graduate.
